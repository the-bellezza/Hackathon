Mercy Oyelami | Developer Portfolio 🌍

Hi there! This is my personal developer portfolio website — a creative, minimalist space where I introduce myself, share my skills, and showcase early projects I’ve worked on as I grow in my tech journey.


🧠 About the Project

This website was built as my **first custom-coded portfolio** using just **HTML and CSS** — no frameworks or builders. It was created to demonstrate my design sense, structure content clearly, and give recruiters or collaborators a peek into who I am as a developer.

🎨 Features

- 🎯 **Clean and minimal layout**
- 📱 **Responsive design** that adapts to desktop and mobile
- 👩‍💻 **About Me section** with downloadable CV
- 🧰 **Skills section** showcasing core tools
- 🗂️ **Portfolio section** with project descriptions and GitHub links
- 📬 **Contact section** for reaching out via email and social platforms

🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML5  
- CSS3 (Custom styling using CSS variables)  
- Responsive Layout (Flexbox & Grid)
